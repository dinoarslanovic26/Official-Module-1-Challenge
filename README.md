# Challenge 1 Module 1 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description
In this Challenge we had to refactor code and reaching the criteria of better accessibility while keeping the Scout Rule in mind. Some changes were made to both CSS and HTML pages to make the more cohesive and were structually sound. Certain HTML elements had to be redone in order to be symantic. In the CSS style sheet there were parts removed and modified in order to meet how the HTML page was strucutred.
